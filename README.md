Uncertainty Architecture

A conceptual framework for structuring, evaluating and governing AI systems under uncertainty.
Status: Early-stage, work-in-progress. Repository currently serves as a placeholder pending partner validation.

⸻

Overview

Uncertainty Architecture is a high-level model for designing and operating AI systems where outcomes are non-deterministic, probabilistic or difficult to fully predict. The framework introduces a structured way to reason about uncertainty across development, evaluation, deployment and governance layers.

It builds on the idea of an AI Control Plane — a management and orchestration layer responsible for coordination, policy enforcement, evaluation loops and risk-aware decision flows in LLM-based and agentic systems. Together, these concepts aim to provide a more stable foundation for building reliable AI applications in environments where uncertainty is intrinsic to system behavior.

This repository collects conceptual materials, outlines and reference structures that will be expanded after industry partner validation.

Goals
	•	Provide a structured conceptual model for handling uncertainty in AI systems.
	•	Define the relationship between the AI Control Plane and uncertainty-aware architectural layers.
	•	Establish terminology and diagrams that help engineering, product and delivery teams build more predictable LLM/AI features.
	•	Serve as the basis for a future public specification.

⸻

Non-Goals
	•	This repository does not contain implementation code.
	•	It is not an operational framework, SDK or library.
	•	It does not define production-ready patterns; final structures will be validated with industry partners before publication.

Current Status

This is an initial placeholder repository.
Full documentation, diagrams, evaluation loops, control-plane components and process structures are in development and will be released in stages.
